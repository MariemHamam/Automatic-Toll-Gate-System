## 🎯 Project Overview

This system detects a vehicle using an IR sensor and automatically opens a gate using a servo motor. After a short delay, the gate closes again. An LCD display shows the system status.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- IR Sensor  
- Servo Motor  
- LCD Display (16x2)  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- Power Source

## 💡 How It Works

1. IR sensor detects the presence of a vehicle.
2. Arduino receives the signal and sends a command to open the gate (servo rotates).
3. LCD displays "Access Granted".
4. After a delay, the gate closes automatically.
